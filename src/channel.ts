/**
 * This function gets called when a channel opens or there is an error opening.
 * It can return a function that can be used to cleanup an logic when the channle closes.
 * If there is an error opening the channel the cleanup function is not called. You can
 * think of it as a stream of values that terminates if/when there is an error. A `skip`
 * function may be provided to skip opening the channel conditionally on every reconnection.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * const closeChannel = client.openChannel({
 *   service: 'shell',
 *   skip: () => !something.supportsShell(),
 * }, ({ channel, error }) => {
 *   if (error) {
 *     // Bail, channel had an error connecting or reconnecting
 *     // Tihs callback will no longer be called
 *     return
 *   }
 *
 *   // Channel is open, setup `channel` logic
 *   // This could be the result of initial connection or a subsequent reconnect
 *
 *   return (reason) => {
 *     // Channel closed, cleanup relevant logic
 *     // We might reconnect after this
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // Eventually when done using the channel you can close it
 * closeChannel() // Will call potential returned cleanup function
